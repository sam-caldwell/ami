AMI Help (overview)

This file mirrors the CLIâ€™s embedded help for convenience when browsing the repo. The single source of truth used by `go:embed` is `src/cmd/ami/helpdata/README.md`. Please update that file to change `ami help` output.

Tip: Run `ami help` to view the embedded help in your terminal.

Tooling tip: print the embedded events schema with `ami events schema --print` (hidden command).
