# Event and Error Typing & Contracts (1.7, 2.2)

This scaffold enforces core event/error typing rules and worker contracts:

Worker Contracts

- Signature: `func f(ctx Context, ev Event<T>, st State) R`
  - `R âˆˆ { Event<U>, []Event<U>, Error<E> }`
  - Enforced when used as workers in pipelines. Invalid signatures emit `E_WORKER_SIGNATURE`.

Event Flow Contracts

- Across pipeline steps, upstream worker output payload `U` must match downstream worker input payload `T`:
  - If step i has workers producing `Event<U>`, and step i+1 has workers consuming `Event<T>`, then `U == T` is required.
  - Violations emit `E_EVENT_TYPE_FLOW`.
  - Error outputs (`Error<E>`) are ignored in normal-path flow checks.

Immutability

- Event parameter is immutable: assignments to the event parameter identifier are illegal (emits `E_EVENT_PARAM_ASSIGN`).
- Pointer/address safety (2.3.2): AMI does not expose raw pointers; `&` is not allowed (`E_PTR_UNSUPPORTED_SYNTAX`). Unary `*` is not a dereference and is only valid on the assignment LHS as a mutability marker.

Tests

- See `src/ami/compiler/sem/event_contracts_test.go` for event flow and parameter immutability.
- See `src/ami/compiler/sem/worker_test.go` for worker signature enforcement.
