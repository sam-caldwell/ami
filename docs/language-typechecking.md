# Imperative Type Checking (Imperative Subset 6.4)

This scaffold implements minimal type checks for imperative constructs using parameter types:

Checks

- Assignment type match: For simple forms `*x = y` and `*p = y` (LHS marked with `*`), where `x`, `y` are function parameters or literals, the checker ensures left and right types match (emits `E_ASSIGN_TYPE_MISMATCH` when they do not). When `x` is a pointer parameter, the LHS type uses the element type for comparison.
- Unary `*` is not a dereference: using `*` in an expression (RHS) emits `E_STAR_MISUSED`.
- Address-of is disallowed: `&` anywhere in source emits `E_PTR_UNSUPPORTED_SYNTAX`.

Scope

- The type environment consists of function parameters (name â†’ type). Local variable declarations are not parsed in this scaffold; expressions are recognized from tokens in simple forms.

Tests

- See `src/ami/compiler/sem/imperative_typecheck_test.go` for happy/sad cases.
