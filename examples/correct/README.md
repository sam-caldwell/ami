Correct Example (Intentional WIP)

This example contains a sketch of an AMI workspace using richer surface syntax that is not yet fully supported by the current parser. It is kept here to drive future language work and intentionally emits diagnostics when built.

For green builds and a working inline worker lowering demo, use:
- examples/inline-body-demo

Nothing in CI depends on building this directory.
