# Multi-Collect Pipelines with IDs and Per-Instance Inputs

This example demonstrates multiple `Collect` instances with explicit IDs and distinct inputs.

Files:
- `src/main.ami`: pipelines with two Collect nodes and edge wiring.

Run:
- Use `ami build` to compile; inspect connectivity under `build/debug/asm/` and contracts under `build/debug/ir/`.
