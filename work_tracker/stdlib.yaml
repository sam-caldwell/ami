notes:
  - Expectations are describe the AMI stdlib, grouped by package and features.
  - Where present, `docx` lists relevant sections from the authoritative document.
  - The AMI stdlib is a built-in and the compiler should generate the object code underneath each feature.
  - Changes should be committed in logical groupings.
  - Status mapping:
    - done→complete
    - todo→ready
    - partial/checklisted→in progress.
  - Completion means:
    - code complete
    - ≥0.80 coverage (happy+sad)
    - all tests passing.
  - Codegen order:
    - simplified object format → debug ASM → LLVM objects.
    - binary artifacts should be statically linked
  - Repository conventions:
    - one declaration per file
    - ≥80% coverage per touched package
    - deterministic outputs
    - JSON/human modes
    - errors to stderr
    - JSON lines for streaming
  - directory layout:
    - source code: `src/`
    - documentation: `docs/`
    - AMI examples: `examples/`
    - End-to-End tests: `tests/`
